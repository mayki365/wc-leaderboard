# LeaderBoard Library

LeaderBoard library contains an awesome LeaderBoard class implementation.

The library stores the matches results in an in-memory sorted collection and has the following properties:

The scoreboard supports the following operations:
* Start a new match, assuming initial score 0 â€“ 0 and adding it the scoreboard.  
  This should capture following parameters:
    * Home team
    * Away team
* Update score. This should receive a pair of absolute scores: home team score and away  
  team score.
* Finish match currently in progress. This removes a match from the scoreboard.
* Get a summary of matches in progress ordered by their total score. The matches with the  
  same total score will be returned ordered by the most recently started match in the  
  scoreboard.

# Dependencies

Core of the solution is implemented with Core Java functionalities. Development dependencies are managed by Maven and are specified in the pom.xml. We are just using the JUnit 5 test framework and Jetbrains Annotations library. The Annotations library allows us explicitly declaring the nullability of elements, the code becomes easier to maintain and less prone to nullability-related errors.

During the development I used IntelliJ IDEA IDE which uses Jetbrains annotation to improve the code quality when extending the functionality.

# Building the Library

Apache Maven is used as a build tool.

Building the libary is simple, just run:
```
maven clean package
```
This will compile and package Java code and create a "target" folder which contains:

* wc-leaderboard-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar - JAR library that can be distributed via a private Maven repository (Nexus, JFrog, ...) or a public one.
* site/jacoco/index.html - Test coverage report
* Java bytecode and intermediate build and test files

# Using the library
```
import static com.sportradar.wc.CountryEnum.*;
import com.sportradar.wc.LeaderBoard;
import com.sportradar.wc.MatchEntry;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        LeaderBoard leaderBoard = LeaderBoard.getInstance();
        leaderBoard.addMatch(new MatchEntry(SLOVENIA, SERBIA, 0, 0));
        leaderBoard.addMatch(new MatchEntry(CROATIA, SERBIA, 0, 0));

        leaderBoard.updateMatch(new MatchEntry(SLOVENIA, SERBIA, 3, 0));
        leaderBoard.updateMatch(new MatchEntry(CROATIA, SERBIA, 0, 2));
        System.out.println(leaderBoard.getScoreBoard());
    }
}
// outputs: [MatchEntry[homeTeam=SLOVENIA, awayTeam=SERBIA, homeScore=3, awayScore=0], MatchEntry[homeTeam=CROATIA, awayTeam=SERBIA, homeScore=0, awayScore=2]]
```

This will produce the following output:
```
[MatchEntry[homeTeam=CROATIA, awayTeam=SERBIA, homeScore=0, awayScore=2], MatchEntry[homeTeam=SLOVENIA, awayTeam=SERBIA, homeScore=2, awayScore=0]]
```
